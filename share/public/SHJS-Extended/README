Syntax Highlighter in JavaScript Extended (SHJSX)

Features
SHJS (http://shjs.sourceforge.net/) is a source code highlighter written in JavaScript and used for presenting code on the web.
	The stuffs that I added to SHJS are:
	1. Added line numbers, based on SHJS-Linenumbers (https://github.com/F1skr/SHJS-Linenumbers/blob/master/src/sh_main.js)
	2. 'Select All' option: Click the option, and the code gets selected. This is so you can copy-paste code quickly :)
	3. Word highlighting: Click on a word (or select a few letters of the word) in the code, and all occurrences of the word are highlighted.
	4. Brace highlighting: Click on a brace and it's matching brace get highlighted. 'Braces' include curly braces {}, square brackets [] and parenthesis ().
	5. Code title: Can add a header title to the code snippet (can be used to display something like "mysnippet.js | One line description").
	
Usage
Go through the source code of the example HTML file.
For using SHJS-Extended on your side, copy-paste the shjsx folder to your site.

Other notes
All the js files have been compressed (minified) with YUI compressor (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/).

SHJS documentation is at the original SHJS project (http://shjs.sourceforge.net/).
